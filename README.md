Generally, an autonomous system compose four subsystems: sensors, perception, planning, and control. A good illustration is the self-driving car system shown in Figure 1.

    <b>Figure 1. Four subsystem components flowchart [1]</b><br>
</p>

The flowchart is a good illustration showing the functionalities of the techniques we learnt from the class:   

1. Localization: Histogram filters, Kalman Filters, and Particle Filters
2. Route Planning (Search): Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A^* and Dynamic Programming
3. Control: Path Smoothing, PID control, and Controller Gain Parameter Optimizations 
4. SLAM: GraphSLAM and Online SLAM
